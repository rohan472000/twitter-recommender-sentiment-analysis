# twitter-recommender-sentiment-analysis
This is a Python project that recommends Twitter users to follow based on their tweets and performs sentiment analysis on their tweets. The project uses the Tweepy library to access the Twitter API and the TextBlob library to perform sentiment analysis.

This project has very small dataset(2000), so prediction will not be that much accurate but you **(viewer)** can contribute to it and make it more accurate.

## Usage
When you run the **python main_app.py** file, the program will prompt you to enter a Twitter username. The program will then retrieve the user's tweets, perform sentiment analysis on the tweets, and recommend other Twitter users to follow based on similar tweets and sentiment analysis.

The program also saves the recommended users and their sentiment scores to a CSV file called **updated_reftweets.csv**.
